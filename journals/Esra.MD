# Monday

It is the first day our group  became together. We shared our ideas. Melody shared that she is interested in with an idea of journal.
David told us about how he likes to see different kind of sources to help people. So he thinks that if we have  page full of personalized resources it might be good.
I drafted the excalidraw our ideas and shared the link with my teammates so they also can contribute.
We started to draw a draft.

At first, we thought it would be great to have the professional and client users separately. But then, we thought we might not handle it.
We also thought that if we have a calendar,, and a user would be able to add tasks and goals, it might be a good guide for people. But we were not able to make a concrete plan with the creating a solid relationship between these features.
For example it was not obvious the relationship between the tasks and goals and the newsfeed.
Also we had this idea of newsfeed but, we didn’t really think about if this is a social web page or not.

We worked a bit more and we created this:

Melody created a login mockup for us that has a journal entry.

I worked on the ideas about how we can make a cohesive web page last night. I did some research. I received some advice from senior engineers about the architecture of the project. According to the information I gathered, I sketched the project from scratch. I created the models and their properties. I also created front end pages and regarding APIs.

In our first meeting, I shared my ideas.  Basically I told:

“3 concerns with the current design:
I think what we did was great but there are some questions in my mind, what would be the relationship in between the models.

I think, the models need to complement each other.

We have journal, we have calendar entry, but the models are unrelated with each other.

Secondly, all of the apps solve a problem they all start with  one main aim.

Fb: find your friends,

Twitter: share your ideas with the world,

Youtube, share videos, etc.

When I was thinking about what problem our app is trying to solve. I thought we are trying to help people to have a better mental health. To help people have better mental health, they need some professional help.

Third, since this is our final project, we need to create something coherent and comprehensive.  If we would do this, we will show our experience in a good way and hopefully impress some potential employers.”

After some discussion, David also offered some ideas about how he envisioned the project. We discussed on his sketch. Eventually, we voted which project we are going to work on. We decided to move on with my design.

We talked a bit about MVP (minimum viable product) and stretch goals.
Also we talked about how to do the multiple user setup. Haven’t make a decision yet.

We started to create issues. Melody made us a google document page.
