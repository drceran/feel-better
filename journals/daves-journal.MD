I did need to rework through the docker-compose file to really understand what was going on there. I did find out how we can host everything on just plain old 8000 instead of the 8080.

I also found the big mistake I was making with the Beekeeper Studio's default database field.

So I've been able to make the Journal List and Form pages, but I wasn't able to implement user authentication/token to allow the logged in user to view entries or use the form because I couldn't carry over the authentication token/cookie... I'll learn that tomorrow!

I've spent the last few days trying to figure out how to finish the authentications and I finally did it! I also learned how to better manage the state with redux. 
I am also going to follow up on the other endpoints to ensure that they work as intended.
